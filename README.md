# Realm-Rush-Game

A tower defence-style game where we need to place arrow turrets in order to destroy enemy barracks that are approaching the gates. Remember that the enemy barracks can change their direction according to your defense strategy.

Implemented object instantiation and management using object pools, designed enemy movement with dynamic pathfinding for enhanced realism, and leveraged advanced coding concepts, including non-MonoBehaviour C# classes, coroutines, and data structures.
